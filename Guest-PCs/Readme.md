# What?
This section holds all the guest environments i have worked on. Which means if i borrow a PC which i have to return, this is the place for that use case configs.

# How?
There are three possible options that i would get a choice eventually, i.e. Either the OS is windows, linux or a macintosh. So we will prepare our guest environment based on those factors only.

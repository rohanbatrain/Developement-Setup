# Preparation

I downloaded manjaro for this particular PC. I wasn't allowed to open the chassy in order to insert my ssd and/or remove windows as this was a guest pc. So i used a usb to sata connector through which my crucial drive is connected and then flashed ventoy to my Sandisk which was laying around.

Disabled secure boot

# Booting

> Booting in normal mode from ventoy and loading opensource drivers, the booting has stuck on 

[OK] Finished Create Volatile Files and Directories

> Booting with grub2 mode in ventoy and loading opensource drivers

This one is stuck on : 

Starting Show Plymouth Boot Screen

> Booting from normal mode in ventoy plus properitary drivers.

same as 2nd

leaving it as is and let's see how much time it takes to boot into manjaro. didn't work after an hour

> changing bios to fallback to add legacy support 

tried Rufus flashing instead of ventoy but it didn't work

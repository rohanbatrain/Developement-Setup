# Preparation

Downloading the iso, turns out that windows have some kind of weirdiness that I've observed recently. While I fresh downloaded manjaro iso before doing CachyOS that particular iso wasn't booting. This time I directly downloaded the iso in ventoy partition and it works perfectly. perhaps windows explorer does some weird things when it comes to file transfers.

# Installation

I attached an external SSD with USB to sata connector and installed CachyOS with ext4 partition on it.

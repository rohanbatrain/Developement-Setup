# Developement Setup

This repository holds my dev setup configuration.

## Dell Latitude E6420 

This was the refurbished laptop my mom got me back in 2018-ish and it worked fine till May 1st 2023, it is not posting. It broke down in middle of my git setup, So yeah Farewell my friend! 

## One-Plus-8T 

This is the device i borrowed from one of my senior to root and learn android developement, and eventually have some fun as my own Samsung F62 got stolen.

## HP pavilion x360 Convertible 

This is the device i am currently using to push changes to the repo. Borrowed from my neighbour for a few days. 


# Developement Specific 

## Dell 

It is gone so let's not talk about it and hurt us.

## OnePlus 8t

Things will be updated


## Guest PC

This is the section which would hold all the config files that i might need on a less secured environment. Like a borrowed PC which i have to return. Cases like these should be treated with this section. Emergency usage of someone else system, making the system optional to our needs and then revert to initials when returning is the goal of this section.

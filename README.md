# Developement Setup

This repository holds my dev setup configuration. It is laid out in form of a journal to document all of which i go through during my setup on a daily basis.

## Dell Latitude E6420 

This was the refurbished laptop my mom got me back in 2018-ish and it worked fine till May 1st 2023, it is not posting. It broke down in middle of my git setup, So yeah Farewell my friend! 

## One-Plus-8T 

This is the device i borrowed from one of my senior to root and learn android developement, and eventually have some fun as my own Samsung F62 got stolen.

## Guest Device

This is the device i would be using to push changes in case of a complete tech failure on my end, It has a dedicated section because the device has to be returned to its owner in the same state as it was when arrived, which means all the config changes should be reverted back to the initials as they were. That is the reason I have separate space for this in my developement setup.

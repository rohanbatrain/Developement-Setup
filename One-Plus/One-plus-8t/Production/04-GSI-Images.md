# DSU Sideloader

We are testing a new realm of no flashing fun, i am tired of bricking my device in testing and in production i guess this is probably the best choice so far. Requirement is to install DSU sideloader.

##  Havoc OS testing on Kebab

1. We downloaded the rom and passed it to dsu sideloader.
2. sideloaded it and now got a prompt to type the following command using adb on the pc to finalize the installation, `adb shell sh "/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/vegabobo.dsusideloader/files/install"` : The following command is just an example and may change in the future. 
3. DSU update is in progress
4. Rebooting

Havoc didn't work 

## Crdroid V9 

It worked, the roms that are listed on dsu sideloader repository they tend to work.

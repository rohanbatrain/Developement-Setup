# Booting into stock

Getting into stock rom is like getting nostlagia. While I wait my device to boot, I am thinking of what made me go into brick state in the first place. 

# Flashing Orangefox 

Flashing orangefox for android 11

1. Booting into fastboot 
2. Command -> `fastboot oem unlock`
3. Phone will wipe itself out
4. I accidently switched to Slot B, after reading this article i got to know that MSM only flashes on Slot A, so SLOT B was empty. 
5. I wasn't able to boot into anything except fastboot, BRICKED but this time i played a smart move, I was already on stock so i relocked the bootloader and Voila it formatted the data and get me into slot A, I am not aware of any other way using fastboot to switch slots as of now, so this was at the time of writing my one of the best approach imo.


## Restart
1. This time downloading android 13 firmware from official Oneplus site and upgrading it from local install. 
2. I read somewhere that there are issues in some devices unlocking the bootloader, so it is recommended to unlock the bootloader first then perform the local upgrade, i'll attach the source later here.

# Kebab & Windows 10 Integrations

Why? 

I am not able to clone my second-brain-private repository on my windows using github desktop, it has the following error.

![image](https://github.com/rohanbatrain/Developement-Setup/assets/116573125/2044f19f-7591-4a46-be21-07a1c61af378)

I know it seems like an authentication issue but all other repositories are just fine and the one with submodule fails, it is perfectly fine on my linux setup also working perfectly in termux.


## What next? 

So in order to use my second-brain-private repository in obsidian on windows, I have to make a simple sync framework. I am currently on a guest Windows laptop so no long term config is to be used like setting up syncthing etc. Rather i am going to start my ftp server on my android and then mount that ftp on windows explorer using which i am going to open my second brain from my android in the windows pc.

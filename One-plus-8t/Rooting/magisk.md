Boot image patching, self explanatory. Images taken from lineage os rom page 


On Kebab (one plus 8t) the magisk installation will be incomplete, when the device reboots let the app do its thing. At the moment writing it's probably going to take 30-45 minutes. I know it seems like it isn't moving but exiting and checking the data usage of magisk indicates that it is using wifi data which gives us hope to have patience.

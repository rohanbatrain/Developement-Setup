# Note of Disclosure:

As a student, I am currently unable to procure software applications due to financial constraints. While acknowledging the potential risks associated with malware, spyware, and other harmful software, I am solely engaging in educational activities. My intention is to acquire knowledge about software before eventually acquiring them through lawful means. Kindly take note of this.
